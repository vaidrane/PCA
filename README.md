# PCA
This is assignment related to basic analysis of PCA (principal component analysis)

Problem Statement-

Download the Air Quality Data Set from UCI ML Repository and edit it for the following purposes.

1.	Change the decimal point from , (comma) to . (dot)
2.	Change -200 to missing value
3.	Remove column numbers 1, 2 and 5. 

Prepare R script for carrying out the following steps. Send the output to a file. Submit the R script and the output file.

After completing the above steps, the data is ready for analysis.

1.	Compute the correlation matrix in two ways using the options use = “complete.obs” and use=”pair”.
2.	Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix in each case.
3.	In each case, identify eigenvalues greater than unity and corresponding eigenvectors.
4.	In each case, find the proportion of variation explained by the selected eigenvalues.
5.	Compute principal component scores in each case.
6.	Make a comparison between the two results and comment on your findings.
